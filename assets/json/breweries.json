      "description": "Belgian trappist brewery.\r\n\r\nThe brewery is located inside the Abbey of Notre-Dame de Saint-Rémy, near the town of Rochefort, and has been brewing beer since 1595. There are approximately 15 monks resident at the monastery. The monks are very secretive about the brewing process, and the brewery is not open to the public, therefore much of the information publicly known about the brewery comes from only a few sources.\r\n\r\nAs with all other trappist breweries, the beer is only sold in order to financially support the monastery and some other good causes. The monks will not increase production based on demand or profit motives, but only enough to support themselves, resulting in a fairly limited supply of beer availability. In practice, there is currently no shortage through regular channels.\r\n\r\n(Brewery  Abbey of Notre-Dame de Saint-Rémy)",

      "description": "Towards the end of the 1970s, Pierre Gobron and Christian Bauweraerts (two brother-in-laws) decided to create their own beer in their own brewery. \r\nWith initially only a small amount of money available to them (200.000Bfr, less than 5.000€), they started out on what the fans of the brewery call the ‘Chouffe story’. \r\n\r\nAt the beginning its founders thought of it as a hobby, but the brewery developed at such a rate that, one by one, they decided to devote themselves to the adventure full-time. The first ‘brassin’ (brewing mix) of LA CHOUFFE (49 litres) was finished on 27th August 1982.\r\n\r\nThe elves of Achouffe were impatient to discover new countries, and their Dutch cousins were the first to give them a warm welcome. Even today, the Netherlands is the major destination of Achouffe Beers outside Belgium. Nowadays, more than 20 countries worldwide are supplied with our ‘nectar’ from the Ardennes forests. Coveted international awards have also been received year after year to reward their unique taste.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the summer of 2006 the founders of the Brewery chose to entrust the future of their dear elves to the Duvel Moortgat Brewery. The group’s wish is to invest in Achouffe and to develop the full potential of the Brewery.",

Around the world, the group is considered to be the leading producer of blond, bottle conditioned, high fermentation beers, a dominant position owed largely to the success of its best-selling product Duvel. A niche player, Duvel Moortgat occupies a leading position in the strategic segments of speciality beers and premium brands like Duvel, Maredsous, Bel Pils and Vedett. The group markets Steendonk white beer in a joint venture with the Palm brewery. Duvel Moortgat has also entered the market of natural fruit juices with a 70% participation in the quality juice producer Freya. Today, the group's beers are exported to over 40 countries. Duvel Moortgat has also taken a firm foothold in Central Europe, thanks to a 50% participation in the Czech Bernard brewery, renowned for its premium Pilsners. The group has launched itself into the market of artisan premium beers through the acquisition of the American Ommegang brewery. Duvel Moortgat has also been listed on the Brussels Euronext stock exchange since 1999.",

It became known in the region for brewing beers like \"La Druide\" and \"Brunehaut 8°\". In 1991 the company took on a new challenge and moved into modern buildings while maintaining its traditional character and the quality of its products, qualified as \"grand crus\" by connoisseurs. An alliance of Modernity and Tradition!\r\nThese are the company's motto, a real creed for the managers at Brunehaut Brewery.\r\n\r\nTradition, because the traditional brewery retains the entirely natural brewing method for late fermentation beers and that are refermented in bottles and kegs. The result: a panel of about a dozen abbey or organic beers, all valuable and unique. To ensure that the link to the region remains strong, the types of barley used in the brewing process are grown in our own farm at Gaurain-Ramecroix.\r\n\r\nModern, because modern and high performance machinery ensure scrupulous compliance with hygiene regulations and a top quality production with consistent flavour. Also modern in how we deal with the market: several beers from Brunehaut won prizes at international competitions and are currently present in 25 different countries.\r\nMarc-Antoine De Mees and his staff are still equally enthusiastic to allow the discovery of this knowledge and method.…",
